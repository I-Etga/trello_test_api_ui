## 1- Issue and Resolution with Query Parameter Handling in REST Assured API Testing Automation

During my API test automation using REST Assured, I encountered an issue regarding the persistence of the value of a query parameter with the same name not being cleared after the first request. This resulted in noticing that both the previous query parameter value and the subsequent one were being sent together in a later API request.

Upon investigation, I discovered that the issue could be resolved using `.config(config().paramConfig(paramConfig().queryParamsUpdateStrategy(REPLACE)))` method, which proved effective in solving the problem.

This feature allows us to define the update strategy for query parameter values. The `REPLACE` parameter, when used, updates the values of query parameters with the same name in each new request and clears the previous values, ensuring that requests are sent without any unwanted accumulation or conflict.

### Example Usage:

```java
.config(config().paramConfig(paramConfig().queryParamsUpdateStrategy(REPLACE)))
